My coursework project on developing a game application using C# and OpenGL.
Archer-sRoute - a game in which you have to play as an archer who is trapped in a dungeon from which he needs to get out.
Implemented:
* **_Core Mechanic_** Dungeon level generation system;
* **_Core Mechanic_** Mechanics of falling asleep (the character really wants to sleep, so after a while he will fall asleep. Until then, you need to collect charcoal for the fire to make a fire and rest in the warmth)
* **_Core Mechanic_** Skill pumping system;
* Hero control (walking + shooting);
* 3 types of enemies:
  * Shooting;
  * Stalking;
  * Wandering;
* Transitioning between levels;
* Several bonuses;
* User interface.
